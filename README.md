## Challenge
Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix is shown below:

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9
```

The left-to-right diagonal = `15`. The right to left diagonal = `17`. Their absolute difference is `|15 - 17|` or `2`.

**Note:** The square matrix will always come in the form of a nested array.

Example:
```python
squarematrix = [[2, 3, 4, 5],
                [5, 5, 5,10],
                [0, 7, 13, 10],
                [9, 9, 9, 9]]

diagonal_difference(squarematrix) == 3
```
